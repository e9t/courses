Data mining and analytical skills are at the heart of solving many important problems in our world.
In this course, we aim to derive technology-based solutions to such problems, and develop strategical decision making abilities based on data.

Specifically, we discuss technologies, applications, practices, and skills for continuous iterative exploration and investigation of business performance with external data collected from diverse sources such as the Web, in order to gain insights and drive business planning.
Topics include statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive modeling, as well as text analytics with visualization.
Students are required to present progress on their work during the semester, and are assessed by a set of assignments, quizzes and exams.
