#### Advice on your projects

1. The best topics are the *topics you are actually interested in*
    - You should be able to "[dogfood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food)" your own analysis
1. Don't be afraid to shift the project's direction
    - However, shifting too much will give you less time for real work -- balance!
1. Feel free to use project results in your graduation project or paper
    - Grab two rabbits at once!
    - These projects have potential to become something in your portfolio
    - May be a plus when you get a job, or apply for grad school

#### Presenting project progress

    1. Prepare printouts (for the whole class) or slides or whatever format that best conveys your work
        - **Please share your materials at the forum before class**
    1. Be brief yet clear
        - Note: [Clarity wins brevity](http://echojuliett.tumblr.com/post/32108001510/clarity-brevity)
    1. Take notes
        - Keep precise research progress and feedback notes
