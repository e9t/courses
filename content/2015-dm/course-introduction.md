    - Assignments (30%): Four graded assignments for you to submit online
    - Final exam (30%): In-class exam covering the whole semester
    - Term project (40%): Group work solving a real world problem

### Assignments (30%)

- Four graded take-home assignments for you to submit online
- Instead of taking a mid-term exam, we will have assignments for reviewing purposes
- Assignments consist of a quiz and a programming task
    - Frankly, the quiz is not for assessment but for you to review and/or preview class materials
    - Programming tasks will cover what you have studied during class. You will have done most of the work in class already. What you're going to do at home is to wrap up your work and document it.
    - Will be open early, and can be submitted at any time
- *Note the submission date*
    - The assignments will still be open even after the due date but you won't get any credit for solving it

### Final exam (30%)

- In-class exam covering the whole semester
- Consists of an easy 80%, a relatively hard 20%
    - If you have fully understood the contents of the assignments, the easy 80% wouldn't be a problem

#### Presentation guidelines
1. Prepare printouts (for the whole class) or slides or whatever format that best conveys your work
    - **Please share your materials to the forum before class**
1. Be brief yet clear
    - Note: [Clarity wins brevity](http://echojuliett.tumblr.com/post/32108001510/clarity-brevity)
1. Record the feedback
    - One can prepare for the presentation
    - Another person can do the presentation
    - And another can take feedback notes
1. A good presentation contains the following:
    1. What questions you had
    1. What approach you chose to alleviate such questions
    1. What results you achieved
    1. What questions you further got and what you plan to do next
    1. Tricks and tips you want to share with the class
1. Extra credit will be given to those who submit and/or rank in an open tournament (ex: [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com))

#### More advice on your projects

1. The best topics are the topics you are actually interested in
    - You should be able to "dogfood" your own analysis
1. Don't be afraid to shift the project's direction
    - However, shifting too much will give you less time for real work -- balance!
1. Feel free to use project results in your graduation project or paper
    - Grab two rabbits at once!
    - These projects have potential to become something in your portfolio
    - May be a plus when you get a job, or apply for grad school
